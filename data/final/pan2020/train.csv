Ninguna  era  Catalunya.  A  lo  mejor  la  ‘deriva  judicial’  es  la  consecuencia  de  petarse  la  Constitución  y  el  Estatut  en  2  días,  en  el  Parlament  (6/7  septiembre  2017).

La  Junta  Electoral  Central  #URL#  Canadá  rechaza  por  2ª  vez  una  autorización  de  viaje  a  Puigdemont.

Esta  vez  lo  ha  tramitado  ‘legalmente’,  pero  le  deniegan  la  entrada.  #HASHTAG#  🇨🇦  #URL#  Como  se  aprecia  en  las  preguntas,  la  cultura  catalana  y  española  son  presentadas  como  2  conceptos  distintos  y  opuestos,  como  si  una  no  formase  parte  de  la  otra.  El  enfoque  nacionalista  de  la  encuesta  resulta  bastante  evidente.    Y  dirigida  a  menores,  no  a  adultos.  Me  parece  que  bastantes  indepes  y  medios  afines  al  nacionalismo,  intentan  confundir  (otra  vez)  a  la  opinión  pública.    Los  CDR  en  libertad  bajo  fianza  no  fueron  acusados  por  ‘nada’,  sino  por  poseer  sustancias  precursoras  de  explosivos.  Y  eso  NO  ha  cambiado.  #URL#  A  veces  se  olvida  que  la  competencia  de  la  administración  penitenciaria  en  Catalunya,  es  exclusiva  de  la  Generalitat.  Desde  hace  décadas.    Como  ejemplo,  ahí  está  el  ‘trato’  que  ha  recibido  Oriol  Pujol.  Los  Junqueras  y  compañía  correrán  la  misma  suerte.  ¿Alguien  lo  duda?  🤷🏻‍♂️  RT  #USER#:  El  incendio  en  la  planta  petroquímica  de  La  Canonja  (Tarragona),  en  las  imágenes,  provoca  la  interrupción  de  trenes  y  el  c…  Lo  que  las  juventudes  de  Esquerra  deberían  haber  hecho,  en  mi  opinión,  es  muy  simple:  Si  ellos  representaban  el  50%  de  los  acampados  (a  modo  de  ejemplo),  entonces  tendrían  derecho  al  50%  de  las  cajas  de  donativos.  Y  el  resto  dejarlo  allí  para  los  que  aún  continúan.  Fácil  y  justo.  RT  #USER#:  Y  terminamos  el  año  con  los  minions  iraníes  asaltando  la  embajada  de  EEUU  en  Bagdad.

A  Gemma  Nierga  se  le  reprochó  luego  la  frase  “Ustedes  que  pueden,  dialoguen  por  favor”  en  la  manifestación  multitudinaria  que  hubo  en  Barcelona.  En  aquella  época  se  pensaba  que  solo  dialogando  con  la  banda  se  acabaría  con  el  terrorismo.

Cuesta  creer  que  realmente  llevase  a  su  hijo  de  8  años  a  cortar  una  carretera,  pero  en  Catalunya  últimamente  hay  gente  MUY  zumbada.

Explotar  la  ínterseccionalidad,  invadir  los  movimientos  sociales  para  obtener  adeptos  a  movimientos  políticos  de  la  izquierda  progresista  latinoamericana,  forma  parte  fundamental  del  eje  de  acción  de  movimientos  como  el  Foro  de  Sao  Paulo  o  el  grupo  de  Puebla.  #URL#  #USER#  #USER#  #USER#  #USER#  Se  dice  ""atengan""  que  viene  de  atenerse  a  las  consecuencias,  si  se  abstienen  de  las  consecuencias,  es  que  no  les  va  a  pasar  nada.  🤣😂  Eso  le  pasa  por  no  oír  a  sus  docentes  en  clase.  #USER#  Incluso  Lubrio  le  discute  que  el  de  Caracas  está  peor  y  reniega  la  palabra  de  un  chavista.

Porque  no  es  lo  mismo  hacer  esa  reducción  por  un  excelente  sistema  médico,  o  hacer  una  dieta  porque  ""es  sano""  a  simplemente  dejar  de  freír  alimentos  porque  no  hay  aceites  ni  ningún  tipo  de  grasa.

Gente  comiendo  brillantina  para  cagar  como  unicornio  y  metiéndose  ajos  en  la  vagina.  Muy  triste  lo  de  Stan  Lee,  la  neta,  pero  pues  teniendo  95  años  no  sé  por  qué  leo  a  muchos  súper  sorprendidos.  Cadena  de  oración  para  que  los  dioses  nórdicos  me  dejen  ver  las  auroras  boreales  en  Islandia.  Te  lo  rogamos,  Odín.  #URL#  #USER#  #USER#  Esa  es  traje  de  gala,  chavo.
